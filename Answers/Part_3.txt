Question 1).

Time complexity:
O(n^3)



Question 2).

B)



Question 3).

D)
If we use median as a pivot element, then the recurrence for all cases
becomes T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) The above recurrence can be solved using
Master Method. It falls in case 2 of master method.


Question 4).

C)



Question 5).

D)

Insertion sort takes linear time when input array is sorted or almost sorted (maximum 1 or 2 elements are misplaced). 
All other sorting algorithms mentioned above will take more than lienear time in their typical implementation.




Question 6).

B)
Selection sort makes O(n) swaps which is minimum among all sorting algorithms mentioned above.




Question 7).
C)
Question 10 Explanation: 
The bubble sort is at its best if the input data is sorted. i.e. If the input data is sorted in the same order 
as expected output. This can be achieved by using one boolean variable. The boolean variable is used to check 
whether the values are swapped at least once in the inner loop.



Question 8).

A)Worst case complexities for the above sorting algorithms are as follows: Merge Sort — nLogn Bubble Sort — n^2 Quick Sort — n^2 Selection Sort — n^2
